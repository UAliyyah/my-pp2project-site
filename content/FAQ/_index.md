*1. My password is expired, how can I reset it?*

- If your password is already expired, please contact ICT and we can reset this for you.

	- going to outlook online at this link: [Outlook online](https://outlook.com)
	- logging into your fft email,
	- clicking your account profile on the top right of the screen

- Your password is expired, please see the answer to question 1.


*3. I have a new phone and now my authenticator does not work. What should I do?*

- Please contact ICT as we will need to reset your MFA (authentication) for you, and connect it to your new phone.


*4. I am struggling with the sharepoint file system. Any guidance?*

- We are now on the sharepoint/ onedrive file system instead of the H drive/shared drive system.
	- Onedrive is where your h drive files have moved over to. 
	- Sharepoint is where your shared drive files have moved to.
- You can access sharepoint and onedrive from any device (work or personal device) at this link: [SP Intranet](https://freedomfromtorture.sharepoint.com/sites/Intranet) 
	- Click the 9 dots in the top left corner to choose which app you want to access, SharePoint or OneDrive
	- This will allow you to access your files online with no setup/logging into remote. 
	- There are some guides on this page which explain how to navigate sharepoint and onedrive. Please do familiarise yourself.
- However, if you would like to access your files from the office computer/work laptop on the file explorer you will need to complete some initial setup.
