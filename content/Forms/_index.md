# Staff Onboarding and Offboarding

__Here are our forms for starter and leaver requests.__

- As we have now switched to online e-forms for this request process, all starter/leaver forms must be filled in online. 
- These can only be accessed by managers. Please notify ICT if you are a manager but do not have access.
- You will no longer need to email these request forms to the relevant department yourself. Your request forms will be sent automatically to the relevant team of FfT, who will get in contact with you.

You can find the starter form at this link: [Starter Form](https://forms.office.com/e/d46nEJMd5W)

You can find the leaver form at this link: [Leaver Form]()
